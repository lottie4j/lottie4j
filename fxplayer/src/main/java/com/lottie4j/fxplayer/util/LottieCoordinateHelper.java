/**
 * Utility class for converting Lottie coordinate system to JavaFX coordinate system.
 * <p>
 * Lottie uses a center-based coordinate system where (0,0) is at the center of the composition.
 * JavaFX uses a top-left based coordinate system where (0,0) is at the top-left corner.
 * <p>
 * ## Lottie Coordinate System
 * <p>
 * The Lottie file format uses a **center-based coordinate system** for layers, which differs from many other graphics formats:
 * <p>
 * The coordinate at the centre of the your layer is 0,0 as its origin. On the x-axis, values to the right the centre-point is positive and to the left is negative. On the y-axis, downwards from the center are positive values and upwards from the center are negative values.
 * <p>
 * ### Key Points:
 * <p>
 * 1. **Origin (0,0)**: Located at the **center** of the layer/composition, not the top-left corner
 * 2. **X-axis**: Positive values extend to the right, negative values to the left
 * 3. **Y-axis**: Positive values extend downward from center, negative values upward from center
 * <p>
 * This is different from many web-based coordinate systems that typically use the top-left corner as the origin. The center-based approach aligns with After Effects' coordinate system (since Lottie animations are often exported from After Effects), where transformations like rotation and scaling work more intuitively when anchored to the center.
 * <p>
 * ### Practical Implications:
 * <p>
 * - If your composition is 400Ã—400 pixels, the coordinate (0,0) would be at pixel position (200,200) if you were thinking in top-left coordinate terms
 * - To position an element at what would traditionally be the "top-left" of a composition, you'd use negative x and y coordinates
 * - This center-based system makes animations and transformations more predictable, especially for rotations and scaling operations
 * <p>
 * This coordinate system is consistent with the vector graphics nature of Lottie and its origins as an After Effects export format.
